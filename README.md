# Instagram-Scraper-App


This is a cool little instagram webscraper project. This is used to target Instagram but it can also be used in any other social media app just changed 
its URL. This app will has a gui and all you have to do is type an instagram account and it will return the accounts follower number, numbers will not be
accurate because Instagram updates the follower count but other than that it works. 

Note that you will need to use the pip install command in the terminal as well as create your own virtual environment to make this work.
